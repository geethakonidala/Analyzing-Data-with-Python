# Analyzing-Data-with-Python
This project is part of completing an online course "Analyzing Data with Python" offered by IBM Whatson

Automobile data set is used through the project and the link is found below.

Ultimate goal is to predict the prize of the car with the help of different variables in the dataset. 

Brief Desription is given for each script below. 

1. Importing Data

2. Data wrangling

3. Exploratory Data Analysis

4. Model Development

5. Model Evaluation & Refinement
      Evaluating the model for accuracy and precision is the final task in building the solution. The developed model should fit the training set. 
      some of the models either overfit or undefit the training set. However when applied on the test set, these models doesn' capture the actual underlying function.
